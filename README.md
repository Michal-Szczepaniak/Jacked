# Jacked
Hello ðŸ‘‹ so this is a mini blackjack game for terminal, also this is the first time I use c++ for software development so please don't mind my horrible code :b 
i compiled it for windows, armv7 and aarch64 linux but unfortunately i don't have a x86 x64 system so i couldn't compile it for x86 x64 linux,

but ofc u can easily compile it using g++, just type:
```
g++ main.cpp -o Jacked
```
i really hope u enjoy it :) and please feel free to donate if u liked it, right now im working on writing some guis, i made this project for fun and a rest cause my exams just finished lol, but after those are finished, im planning on making Jacked multiplayer, im thinking about making it work with telnet and also will add games cash and it will be even better i guess :D
